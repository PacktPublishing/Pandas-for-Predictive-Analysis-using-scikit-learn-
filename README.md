# Pandas for Predictive Analysis using scikit-learn [Video]
This is the code repository for [Pandas for Predictive Analysis using scikit-learn [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/pandas-predictive-analysis-using-scikit-learn-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788391429), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course we learn that stand alone data analysis is fine but what most companies these days are looking for is to do Predictive analysis using their data. In this advanced course, we will make you ready to start doing Predictive Analysis on your data by showing you how to build Machine Learning models with scikit-learn and pandas. 

In this course, you will be training models and be making data based predictions using scikit-learn.The user will like this as a standalone product as Making Predictions data using Machine Learning is an absolute minimum skill for any Data Analyst \ Data Scientist these days. We will teach users how to use scikit-learn to make data based predictions. User will learn how to bring in their data using pandas, apply some machine learning models and take out the predictions. We will also walk the user through various popular Machine Learning algorithms. 

By the end of this course, the user will be quite confident of doing Predictive Analysis on their own. This subject matter is big enough that 2-3 hours of stand alone course is absolute bare minimum to achieve it.
